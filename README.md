# Natural Search

This component to search things via facets. 

See the component in action on [the demo page](https://ecodev.github.io/natural-search).

## Install

```bash
yarn add @ecodev/natural-search
```

## Development

The most useful commands for development are:

- `yarn dev` to start a development server
- `yarn build-docs` to build and commit (but not push) the docs/demo page
- `yarn release` to publish the lib to npm

## Prior work

While the implementation is entirely different, [VisualSearch.js
](https://github.com/documentcloud/visualsearch/) was an important inspiration.
