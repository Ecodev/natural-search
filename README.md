This is an Angular component to search for things via configurable facets. Facets may be
configured to use one of the built-in component, or a custom component to input values.

See the component in action on [the demo page](https://ecodev.github.io/natural-search).

## Install

```bash
yarn add @ecodev/natural-search
```

## Development

The most useful commands for development are:

- `yarn dev` to start a development server
- `yarn build-docs` to build the docs locally (it will be published automatically by Travis)
- `yarn release` to publish the lib to npm

## Prior work

While the implementation is entirely different, [VisualSearch.js
](https://github.com/documentcloud/visualsearch/) was an important inspiration.
